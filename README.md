## 📊 Heart Disease EDA: Unlocking Insights with Pandas & Seaborn  

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. But what if we could uncover hidden patterns in heart disease data using Python? 🚀  

In this post, I dive into **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a heart disease dataset using **Pandas & Seaborn** to extract key insights. Here’s what I did:  

🔍 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Handled missing values, checked data types, and performed outlier detection.  
- Encoded categorical features for better analysis.  

📈 **Visualizing Key Insights with Seaborn**  
- **Correlation Heatmap** 🔥 to understand feature relationships.  
- **Boxplots & Violin Plots** to identify risk factors like cholesterol levels & age.  
- **Pairplots & Histograms** to observe distributions and trends.  

💡 **Findings:**  
- Age & cholesterol levels show significant influence.  
- Higher blood pressure correlates with heart disease risk.  
- Certain chest pain types have a stronger association with diagnosis.
